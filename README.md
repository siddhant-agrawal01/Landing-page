# Mobile App Landing Page

This is a landing page for a mobile application built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, providing enhanced code quality and developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development without writing custom CSS.

## Benefits of the Tech Stack

### Next.js
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Improves performance and SEO by rendering pages on the server or at build time.
- **API Routes**: Easily create backend endpoints within the Next.js application.
- **File-based Routing**: Simplifies the creation of routes without the need for additional libraries.

### TypeScript
- **Type Safety**: Reduces runtime errors by catching type-related issues during development.
- **Enhanced IDE Support**: Provides autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring capabilities, leading to improved developer productivity.
- **Scalability**: Makes large codebases easier to manage and maintain.

### Tailwind CSS
- **Utility-First Approach**: Speeds up development by using pre-defined classes directly in the markup.
- **Customization**: Allows easy customization of styles via configuration files.
- **Responsive Design**: Provides responsive design utilities out-of-the-box.

## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
